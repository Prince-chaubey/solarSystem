Solar System 3D Simulation with Three.js

Description:
This project is a 3D simulation of our solar system built with Three.js. It features all 8 planets orbiting the Sun with realistic relative sizes and orbital speeds. Users can interact with the simulation by adjusting individual planet speeds through a control panel.

Features:

☀️ Sun at the center with 8 orbiting planets (Mercury to Neptune)

🪐 Realistic relative planet sizes and orbital distances

⏱️ Adjustable orbital speeds for each planet via interactive controls

🎥 Responsive 3D scene that works on mobile and desktop

✨ Optional bonus features (see below)

Bonus Features Implemented:

⏯️ Pause/Resume animation button

🌟 Background starfield

Usage:

Use the control panel to adjust individual planet speeds

Click the Pause/Resume button to stop/start the animation
